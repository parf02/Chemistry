This repo lists the two projects that I created related to chemistry

codeFluorimeter was written to sample data from a home built fluorimeter
using a NIDAQ in MATLAB.

homeSecurity.bs2 was created for a laboratory automation class (CHEM547). The software written in PBASIC controlled a BASIC STAMP which was used to control a 
home built security system. This system had an RFID reader to lock/unlock the system, a sensor to detect door opening and a light sensor to turn on the system at night automatically.
